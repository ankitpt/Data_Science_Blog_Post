### Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. The dataset I chose had statitics of players in top 5 soccer leagues across Europe from year 2014-2015 to 2019-20. Apart from attributes like goals, assists, yellow and red cards,etc, there were some other interesting statistics such as expected goals, expected assists, key passes,etc. 


With the data at hand, I tried to answer following questions:

Which league has the most attacking defenders across Europe's top 5 league in the last 6 seasons? 
Who are the most unlucky players? Which strikers are most lethal in front of the goal?
Which teams are most dependent on a single or couple of players in a particular season?
