### Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. The dataset I chose had statitics of players in top 5 soccer leagues across Europe from year 2014-2015 to 2019-20. Apart from attributes like goals, assists, yellow and red cards,etc, there were some other interesting statistics such as expected goals, expected assists, key passes,etc. 


With the data at hand, I tried to answer following questions:

- Which league has the most attacking defenders across Europe's top 5 league in the last 6 seasons? 
- Which teams outperform their expected goals measure while which ones underperform (and in which season)? How is it related to performance in respective league in that year? Further, which teams constantly outperform their expected goals measure?
- One man army: In a particular season and league, which teams were most dependent on a single player for scoring goals?
